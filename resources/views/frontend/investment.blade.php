      Together, we will create and sustain excellence in scholarship, teaching, and learning, 
      in an environment that is not afraid of taking risks, testing bold ideas, hypothesis and
       rethinking traditional approaches to problems. 
        We dare to ask new questions and celebrate the synergy and solutions that result when people
         from seemingly unrelated disciplines join together for a common cause. With additional private
          support, we will be able to bring a wider spectrum of research opportunities to Unical and 
          consequently offer more solutions to the University community and the world.
